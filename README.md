# KA Coins
Khan Academy Coins (KA Coins) is a standard API for a "coin system" on Khan Academy's HTML programming interface.

*Unfortunately, this does not currently work, since KA does not have an available storage API.*

To link the KA Coins API to your program, add the following line of code (for version 0.0.1):
```
<script type="text/javascript" src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/KADevelopers/ka-coins@7dd0e10f7e03262251549e44be54cbd2d4a61739/src.js"></script>
```
